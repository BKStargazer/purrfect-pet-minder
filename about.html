        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>The Purrfect Pet Minder was born from my own need to find loving, attentive care for my cats when work required me to travel. I have used catteries before and while the staff were loving and caring, it was still stressful for my cats adjusting to a new environment.</p>
        <p>The Purrfect Pet Minder avoids the unnecessary stress of your cats having to adjust to a new environment
